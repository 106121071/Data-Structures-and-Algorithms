#Problem Description
Find the Union of Two sorted arrays

In simple words the meaning is that the union of array a1 with array a2 is the set of elements that are in
either in array a1 or in a2.

Example1:

Input:
a1: [1 2 2 3 4]  
a2: [1 1 2 3 4 4 5 6]

OUTPUT:
[1 2 3 4 5 6]

Example 2:

Input:
a1: [3 4 5 5 6 ]
a2: [2 3 3 4 5]

OUTPUT:
[2 3 4 5 6]

#Overall Time complexity will be: O(n+m) where n will be the number of elements of the first array and m will
Be the number of elements of second array.
